# FIRMIN IN THE CITY

## About The Project

**Firmin in the City** is an interactive portfolio experience built to
showcase my work as a game developer.

Hello, my name is **Gustavo Gutiérrez**, and this project is a playful
way to introduce who I am and what I create.

In this application, you take on the role of **Firmin**, a small goblin
hacker navigating through the city, a subway station, and a
teleportation system. As you explore, you access three main sections of
my portfolio.

### The Three Sections

1.  **Profile** -- A department where I describe who I am, my interests, and
    my contact information.\
2.  **Art** -- A theatre where I display a selection of my artwork.\
3.  **Projects** -- A Wall‑Street--style building where I present and
    explain some of my projects.

## Built With

-   Phaser 3
-   JavaScript (ES6+)
-   NPM

## Usage

Use arrow keys (or WASD) and action key (e.g., Enter or Space) to guide
Firmin through the city.\
Visit each section (Profile, Art, Projects) to learn about me and see my
work in a playful, interactive way.
